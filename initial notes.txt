BODS

Digital platform whichc consumes published data sets for timetables/locations of buses

processes it

and outputs it in the form of function/API on the other the side of "sausage machine" lol




Data is consumed by consumers

not very consumer savvy

mobile apps for passengers/ websites, making it easy for people to understand the data 


incorporating live data?



Main Task:

Basically, onboarding Belfast resources into teh SE team to help

Gov project, so need to sign IPP

Only Use Case that we can use is the public data that is available.

Making some exciting visuals/interactive app with the public data to satisfy client requests
(Developing some form of publicity for KPMG)
(They don't have time to read/understand the small detail, get something tangible in front of them so that thye understand)


Hopefully some form of GitHub access being requested/already requested


Savvy vs Non-Savvy users:

Timetables not very standaradized,
accuracy issues


Fares are the biggest issue, messy data
main goal is to understand and extract the data, so that it is similar to the timetable data.


Then visualize/map the data in an interesting way:

(Need to figure out the best way to visualize things)





2 caviates

Spencer & Adam - (Spencer on Holiday, Adam joining on Monday)

Isri - Governing the Project

Sprints - Jira Boards - Seems things tend to be fairly organized




Need to get onboarded quickly, define a scope that we can get started on quickly


Open Data - Open Source
Some Technologies we may not be able to use

Extract the Data
Look at the quality
Analyse the Data


Defining the Scope, presenting the issues/questions, defining the next steps (Analytical/Visual)














Instead of using time as a factor, figure out from A > B how much it will cost

How much could a cost of ______ get you if you left from A and wanted to head towards B

How many times would I have to change over buses

The time taken






Understanding the data and structuring it a way that it is ready for visualization
