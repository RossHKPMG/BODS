nocs=["BPTR", "RBTS"],      # NOC = National Operators Codes, 4 digit code used to specify an operator (NB. One operator could have multiple NOC's associated with it)
status="published",         # Limit results to data sets with the specified status string, accepted values are: 'published' or 'inactive'
boundingBox                 # Limit results to fares data sets that contain information for the area within the rectangular boundingBox you set using co-ordinates ([minLatitude, maxLatitude, minLongitude, maxLongitude])
limit=0,                    # The Maximum number of records to return
offset=0,                   # Returns results that match the query starting from the specified offset *

service_line_level=True,    # True if you require Service line data 
stop_level=True,            # True if you require stop level data



* If we say that our offset = 10 and limit = 25, offset will skip the first 10 instances,
  so instead of getting results 1 - 25
  you will instead get results 11 - 36


Example (Return at max 5 records from the operator whose NOC is "Ross" using my API key)
 
api_key = [My API Key],
nocs=["ROSS"],
status="published",
boundingBox = [],
limit=5,
offset=0,
